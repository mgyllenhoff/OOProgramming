The following program tests your ability to develop a simple C++ program and specify adequate testing:

Your program should read three integer values. The three values are interpreted as representing the integer lengths of the sides of a triangle. 
The program prints as message that states whether the triangle is equilateral (three side equal), isosceles (two side equal) or scalene 
(no side equal).

Instructions:
Design and implement the program in C++ (with error handling where appropriate)
Develop a set of test cases that you feel will adequately test this program.
Apply the test cases to your implementation.
